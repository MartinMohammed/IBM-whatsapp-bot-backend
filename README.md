Sure! Here's the updated version of the webhook API documentation based on our conversation:

## Webhook API Documentation

The Webhook API is an HTTP-based API that allows you to receive and process incoming messages from WhatsApp. This documentation provides an overview of the API endpoints, request/response formats, and examples of how to use the API.

### Base URL

The base URL for the Webhook API is `https://your-domain.com/webhook`.

### Endpoints

#### `GET /webhook`

This endpoint is used to verify the callback URL from the WhatsApp dashboard. It should be called with the following query parameters:

- `hub.mode`: The mode of the webhook subscription. Set it to "subscribe".
- `hub.challenge`: A random string generated by WhatsApp for verification.
- `hub.verify_token`: The verification token provided by WhatsApp.

##### Request Example

```
GET /webhook?hub.mode=subscribe&hub.challenge=123456789&hub.verify_token=your-verification-token
```

##### Response Example

```
Status: 200 OK

123456789
```

#### `POST /webhook`

This endpoint is used to receive incoming messages from WhatsApp. The payload of the request will contain the message details.

##### Request Example

```
POST /webhook

{
  "object": "whatsapp_business_account",
  "entry": [
    {
      "id": "123456789",
      "changes": [
        {
          "value": {
            "messaging_product": "whatsapp",
            "metadata": {
              "display_phone_number": "+1234567890",
              "phone_number_id": "987654321"
            },
            "contacts": [
              {
                "profile": {
                  "name": "John Doe"
                },
                "wa_id": "1234567890"
              }
            ],
            "messages": [
              {
                "from": "1234567890",
                "id": "987654321",
                "timestamp": 1654321000,

                  "body": "Hello, World!"
                }
              }
            ]
          },
          "field": "messages"
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

##### Response Example

```
Status: 200 OK
```

### Error Handling

If there is an error during the processing of a request, the API will respond with an appropriate HTTP status code and an error message in the response body.

### Libraries and Dependencies

The Webhook API is built using the following libraries and dependencies:

- Express.js: A fast and minimalist web framework for Node.js.
- body-parser: Middleware for parsing JSON requests.
- nodemon: Development tool that automatically restarts the server when code changes are detected.
- TypeScript: A typed superset of JavaScript that compiles to plain JavaScript.
- UglifyJS: A JavaScript parser, minifier, and mangler library.

### Development Workflow

To set up the development environment and start the webhook API, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/your-repo.git`
2. Install dependencies: `npm install`
3. Start the development server: `npm run dev`

### Deployment

To deploy the webhook API to a production environment, follow these steps:

1. Build the application: `npm run build`
2. Set the necessary environment variables, such as the `PORT` and `VERIFY_TOKEN`.
3. Deploy the application to your hosting provider of choice.

### Conclusion

The Webhook API provides a seamless integration with WhatsApp, allowing you to receive and process messages from users. By following this documentation, you can easily set up and deploy the webhook API for your application.

Please note that this documentation is a template and should be customized based on your specific API implementation and requirements.
